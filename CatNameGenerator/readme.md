#Cat Name Generator

**When the user presses the button a cat name is randomly chosen, and
printed out to the screen.**

The cat names are stored in an array, and there is a random() function that generates a random number between 0 - number of cats. So when button is pressed a while-loop will print out the text to the screen, the while-loop will reset every time the button is pressed. So that a new name can be printed out each time without refreshing the browser.
